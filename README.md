Details: Implemented features (concise)

1) Enhanced UI for Home, Login & Sign Up screens
- Modern, minimal, futuristic design language with purple gradient tones (light violet to deep violet).
- Clean app header, rounded cards, soft shadows, and comfortable spacing for readability.
- Home screen is fully scrollable and responsive across device sizes.

2) Integrated API with Login & Sign Up + error handling
- Authentication endpoints wired to the UI flows for Login and Sign Up.
- Input validation, network error handling, and user-facing error messages implemented.
- Secure token handling and local persistence (where appropriate in this build).

3) Built Home screen & connected JSON data
- Home tab includes a top bar showing the logged-in user name, static profile picture, and a notification bell icon on the right.
- Horizontally scrollable category cards consume the mock JSON from `assets/categories.json`.
- Featured/Recommended courses section with visually appealing cards; cards are tappable and navigate to course details.

4) Passed data to Categories & Courses screens
- Category selections pass the selected category payload to the Categories screen.
- Course selections pass course data to a Course Details/Course Player screen.

Mock data example (used for UI development)

assets/categories.json

```json
[
  { "id": 1, "title": "Flutter Development", "image": "flutter.png" },
  { "id": 2, "title": "Web Design", "image": "web.png" },
  { "id": 3, "title": "AI & Machine Learning", "image": "ai.png" },
  { "id": 4, "title": "Data Analysis", "image": "data.png" }
]
```

---

How to run (local)

1) Ensure Flutter is installed and configured: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2) From the project root, fetch packages:

    flutter pub get

3) Run the app (choose device or emulator):

    flutter run

Notes:
- The app uses assets declared in `pubspec.yaml`; if you add new assets, run `flutter pub get` and rebuild.
- If you update platform files, use the normal Flutter platform build commands (e.g., `flutter build apk`).

Developer notes & next steps

- Tests: Add widget tests for Home, Login, and Sign Up flows. A minimal `test/widget_test.dart` exists as a starting point.
- Accessibility: Review color contrast for purple gradient backgrounds and ensure tappable areas meet size recommendations.
- API: Add retry/backoff and more granular error states for production readiness.
- Analytics & Logging: Integrate analytics and structured logs for usage insights and error diagnosis.
